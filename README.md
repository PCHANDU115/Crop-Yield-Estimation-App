# Crop-Yield-Estimation-Webapp


# Purpose:
The Crop Yield Estimation Tool is designed to assist farmers, agricultural professionals, and researchers in estimating crop yields based on various parameters. By leveraging modern computation, it simplifies decision-making in agriculture, helping users optimize resource usage and plan effectively for better production.

# Key goals:

Provide an interactive platform for estimating yields of crops like wheat, corn, and rice.
Visualize contributions of inputs like fertilizer, pesticide, and water availability using charts.
Allow users to dynamically adjust parameters and analyze the impact on crop yield.
Hereâ€™s a structured approach for writing README implementation steps for a project deployed using Streamlit:


---

# Implementation Steps

# 1. Data Input

Collect or prepare the dataset for your project. Ensure it is clean and well-organized.

Save the dataset in formats such as .csv, .json, or .xlsx.

Place the dataset in the project directory or load it dynamically from an API, if 



---

# 2. Data Preprocessing and Model Loading

If your project involves preprocessing:

Include text cleaning, stemming, lemmatization, or normalization (e.g., using NLTK or SpaCy).


Use pre-trained models or train your model and save it as a file (e.g., model.pkl):




---

# 3. Streamlit Application Development

Create a main.py file as the entry point for your Streamlit app.

# 4.Build the Streamlit UI:

Add input widgets (st.text_input, st.selectbox, etc.).

Display results using st.write, st.table, or visualizations like st.bar_chart.



---
# 4.Testing Locally

Run the Streamlit app locally for testing:

streamlit run main.py

Debug and ensure all functionalities are working.



---

# 5. Deployment

Deploy using Streamlit Cloud:

1. Push your project to GitHub.


2. Go to Streamlit Cloud.


3. Link your GitHub repository and deploy.



Deploy using other platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS):

Prepare a requirements.txt or Pipfile.

Add a Procfile for deployment (if necessary).




---

# 6. Usage Guide

Open the deployed URL (provided by the deployment platform).

Enter the required input in the UI.

View predictions, results, or visualizations on the app.
